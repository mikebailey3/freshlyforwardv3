Every bullet should answer "so what?" -- use numbers wherever you can.\n\nCut anything older than 10-15 years unless it is directly relevant. Recruiters care about your trajectory, not your whole history.\n\nMatch the language of the job posting. Applicant tracking systems and human reviewers both respond to shared vocabulary.\n\nKeep formatting simple and scannable. One page for most roles, clear section headers, no dense paragraphs.\n\nProofread out loud. Typos are one of the fastest ways to lose credibility before anyone reads your experience.',
